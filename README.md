# Dynasnap

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I built this web browser extension originally for myself working as a Dynamics 365 developer as I found that bugs were being stored in different places (Excel) or they didn't have enough information to fix. 

Dynasnap's goal is to save developer's time by having all of the details at once (diagnostics  from Dynamics 365, screenshots and page urls) in DevOps. 

## Security

This repo contains the core manifest and content scripts used in the Dynasnap Chrome extension.

These files show exactly what permissions are used, and how the extension interacts with the browser.

## Issues/Feedback

Issues can be raised with the web extension and your feedback would be really valuable (good or bad) to make this extension better :)
