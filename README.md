# Dynasnap

Hi ðŸ‘‹ I built this web browser extension originally for myself working as a Dynamics 365 developer as I found that bugs were being stored in different places (Excel) or they didn't have enough information to fix. 

Dynasnap's goal is to save developer's time by having all of the details at once (diagnostics  from Dynamics 365, screenshots and page urls) in DevOps.
